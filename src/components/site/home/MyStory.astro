      I will live this technological transformation, and so will you. Together, we will witness the acceleration of
      intelligence, the merging of imagination with code, and the unfolding of possibilities that will reshape how we
      think, create, and interact with the world. Every innovation, every discovery, every horizon that emergesâ€”we will
      experience in a future that is already taking form.

    <!-- Bio -->
    <p class="text-foreground text-xs leading-relaxed font-sans max-w-md">
      I'm a technologist with a focus on R&D and a generalist's curiosity. By day, I work with R&D in innovative AI
      solutions at <a href="https://neuralmind.ai" class="link">NeuralMind</a>, and in my own time, I lead and develop
      experimental projects as a founder at <a href="https://9aia.com" class="link">Gaia</a>. This hands-on experience
      is supported by a formal undergraduate degree in AI at <a href="https://fiap.com.br" class="link">FIAP</a> along with
      continuous self-taught learning. In my free time, I have my creative pursuits, which include hobby gamedev under my
      organization,
      <a href="https://github.com/agarage" class="link">A. Abstract</a>. I also have broader fascinations with the
      future, STEM, and philosophy, and I enjoy sci-fi as a form of leisure.
